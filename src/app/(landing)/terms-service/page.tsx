        decisions, and instructions made through your account. While the Site
        may provide data, information, or content—including from third
        parties—regarding investment strategies or opportunities, such content
        should not be construed as tax, legal, financial, or investment advice,
        nor as a recommendation to invest in any specific offering. Investment
        decisions are made entirely at your own risk and should be based solely
        on your own analysis of the associated risks. This includes the
        potential loss of your entire principal investment. Using the Site or
        Services does not establish a fiduciary relationship between you and
        SecureSeedFund. You acknowledge that you are responsible for conducting
        your own legal, accounting, and due diligence reviews of any investment
        opportunities presented on the Site. It is strongly recommended that you
        consult licensed legal professionals and investment advisors for advice
        regarding legal, tax, insurance, or investment matters, as the Site does
        not provide such advice or recommendations
